Neumodore uses the pomodoro focus method. in this method, a pomodoro means a period of four pomodori, which are composed of four periods of execution with brief moments of rest.

To begin the technique, you will need to have an alarm clock or stopwatch and note paper beside you.

If your goal is to study, for example, then start your study and don't stop doing that task for exactly 25 minutes. When the time is up, rest for five minutes (you can go to the bathroom, look at your cell phone or just relax, for example). Then go back to the task and stay another 25 minutes, and so on.

That is: perform the task for 25 minutes. Stop, rest 5 minutes. Go back and do another 25 minutes, and so on.

After completing this cycle four times, increase your rest to 15 minutes. Then, go back and repeat the process until you perform four steps again. The whole procedure should take two hours.

Neumodore is an experience that is being improved, continuously at all times, to bring you the best experience of using the pomodoro technique with a neumorphic appearance.
